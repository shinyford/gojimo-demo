# gojimo-demo
Programming exercise for Gojimo

This demo was developed test-first (tests added and made to pass pretty-much in the order they appear in gojimo-demo-test.rb) using Sinatra, DataMapper and jQuery.

Note that I've limited this to displaying only those qualifications for which subjects exist - many in the feed json were subjectless.

The webapp here is not, I'll admit, the prettiest - but it is responsive in a limited way, and wouldn't take much to make far more appealing. (UX is more my forte than straight design, sadly - happy to work with designers, but not really in my gift to replace them. :D )

This webapp can be seen in action at http://gojimo-demo.gomes.com.es
